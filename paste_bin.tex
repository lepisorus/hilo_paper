While the large number of environmental factors implies that a large number of adaptive changes may be required to colonize     high altitude environments, evidence of selection in multiple mammal species consistent with the idea that parallel adaptation dep    ends on the genetic architecture of individual traits.\cite[]{Yi_2010_20595611,Simonson_2010_20466884,Storz_2007_17397259,Qiu_2012_    22751099}.
