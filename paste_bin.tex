%For discussion:

While the large number of environmental factors implies that a large number of adaptive changes may be required to colonize     high altitude environments, evidence of selection in multiple mammal species consistent with the idea that parallel adaptation dep    ends on the genetic architecture of individual traits.\cite[]{Yi_2010_20595611,Simonson_2010_20466884,Storz_2007_17397259,Qiu_2012_    22751099}.

In summary, the progenitor populations of highland maize (lowland maize and \emph{parviglumis}) contain both genotypes of highly differentiated SNPs implying adaptation from standing variation.
However, standing variation may be difficult to distinguish from gene flow between lowland and highland populations due to their recent divergence in units of $N_A$.
An additional caveat is that our inference of adaptation from standing variation assumes that our highly differentiated SNPs are causal and not merely linked to the targets of adaptation.  A causal variant at some distance from the assayed SNP may have had the opportunity to recombine onto multiple backgrounds. 
Given the previously documented rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium in maize \cite[]{Tenaillon_2001_11470895,Remington_2001_11562485} that is also apparent in our data (supp fig.~X) we are also likely missing a number of selected loci not in LD with the SNPs assayed here.

%\st{(Or we can say without gene flow, we can well explain the observed pattern of polymorphisms).
%Lots of shared polymorphisms between maize and teosinte may support the standing variation hypo? Standing variation hypo holds as long as the effect of gene flow between maize and teosinte is negligible. 
%In fact, \cite{vanHeerwaarden_2011_21189301} estimated admixture between Mexico lowlands maize and \emph{parviglumis} to be very low. 
%Admixture from  \emph{parviglumis} to maize may alter the shape of the null distributions of $F_{ST}$ values.
%We checked even high admixture (up to 20\%) did not change the distributions (\cite{vanHeerwaarden_2011_21189301} estimated a few percentage of admixture).
%Thus, our $F_{ST}$ outlier approach is conservative on gene flow.}

%Or independently selected genes in Mexico and South America may belong to the same metabolic? chemical? pathway.  
%It may be worth doing maizecys. \jri{ let's make sure we have figured out standing var for SNP frequencies and GU before doing maizecyc.  but indeed might be worth doing.  let's hold off for now, though.} \comst{yeah}


%Effective population size low $<$ high in Mexico and low $>$ high in South America



%Would be good to have a figure showing observed and expected overlap in SNPs and Genes.



%We obtained teosinte (both  and \emph{mexicana}) SNPs in 46 of 56 SNPs from .  39 SNPs exhibited polymorphisms in teosinte, indicating selective sweep from standing genetic variation.  The other seven SNPs showed monomorphic in teosinte.  Only in two of seven SNPs, the frequencies of derived alleles were increased in highland populations.
