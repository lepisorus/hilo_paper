\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Materials and DNA extraction}
We included 94 landraces (24, 24, 23 and 23 landraces sampled from Mexico lowland, Mexico highland, SA lowland and SA highland (Andean) populations).  These lines were provided by USDA and Major Goodman (supp Table S1).  Sampling locations are shown in Figure~\ref{map}A (see also supp table S1).   Lowland landraces were sampled from altitudes $<$1,700 m and highland landraces from  $>$1,700 m (supp table S1).  \comst{Matt, there is no information of the origin for some landraces (NA in supp table S1.  Do you have an idea?}  \mbh{I've saved a spreadsheet in the main folder of the dropbox with all the information I have on the accessions}Seeds were germinated on filter paper following fungicide treatment and grown in standard potting mix.  Leaf tips were harvested from plants at the five leaf stage.  Following storage at $-80{}^\circ$C overnight, leaf tips were lyophilized for 48 hours.  Tissue was then homogenized with a Mini-Beadbeater-8 (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK, USA).  DNA was extracted using a modified CTAB protocol \cite[]{CTAB}.  The quality of DNA was ensured using methods described in \cite{vanHeerwaarden_2011_21189301}.

%Purity of extracted DNA was measured with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA).  Samples with 260:280 ratios $\geq$1.8 were deemed acceptable for genotyping.  Concentrations of DNA extractions were determined with a Wallac VICTOR2 fluorescence plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Torrance, CA, USA) using the Quant-iT$^{TM}$ Picogreen(R) dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). \jri{we don't need to repeat all this, we can just cite van Heerwaarden 2012 PNAS or  Pyh\"aj\"arvi or Hufford (submitted) or maybe even Cook 2012 Plant Phys. for methods}

\subsection*{SNP data}
We used the maize B73 genome sequence RefGen version 2 as a reference \cite[]{Schnable_2009_19965430}.  
The filtered gene set (version 5b\_FGS) was retrieved from MaizeSequence.org for SNP annotations.  
We excluded transposable elements and pseudogenes from the filtered gene set. 
%\jri{we excluded TEs? TEs aren't in the FGS are they? What did you do to exclude these?}
%\comst{Jeff - there are 39249 protein coding genes, 323 pseudogenes and 84 transposable element in the FGS.} 
%\mbh{Sho, did you filter the FGS yourself for pseudogenes and TE's? If so, probably need to briefly describe your method.  If not, where did these annotations come from?  My understanding is these should be excluded from the FGS.}
Results were qualitatively similar when using the less stringently filtered working gene set (not shown).

We generated two complementary SNP data sets for the sampled maize landraces. 
The first set was generated using the Illumina MaizeSNP50 BeadChip platform, including 56,110
SNPs \cite[]{Ganal_2011_22174790}.  SNPs were clustered with the default algorithm of the GenomeStudio Genotyping Module v1.0 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).   
Clustering for each SNP was then visually inspected and manually adjusted.  
These data are referred to as "MaizeSNP50" hereafter.  
MaizeSNP50 data have high reproducibility and a low proportion of missing data but are subject to ascertainment bias. 
This array contains SNPs discovered in five ascertainment schemes \cite[]{Ganal_2011_22174790}; however, the vast majority of SNPs come from two panels: the Syngenta set (14,810 SNPs), derived from polymorphisms distinguishing the parents of the IBM mapping population (the maize lines B73 and Mo17), and the Panzea set, including 40,594 SNPs identified during sequencing of the 25 parents of the NAM mapping population.  
%\comst{numbers of panzea and syngenta SNPs will be added later}

The second data set was generated utilizing high-throughput Illumina sequencing data in a method referred to as \underline{g}enotyping-\underline{b}y-\underline{s}equencing (GBS).  \textcolor{red}{Kelly is up for details.}
Average coverage was relatively low \textcolor{red}{(5X?)} \jri{think more like 1X at best} resulting in heterozygotes often being miscalled as homozygotes.  However, this data set is relatively free from ascertainment bias.       
GBS data were obtained for a subset of 23, 23, 20 and 21 lines for Mexico lowland, Mexico highland, SA lowland and SA highland populations respectively (supp table S1).

%\subsection*{Quality of SNP data sets}

We compared SNP genotypes in the GBS and MaizeSNP50 data sets to assess data quality. 
Previous work has shown 2.45\% discordance in SNP genotypes between the maize HapMap2 data set and the MaizeSNP50 array. 
Most errors were due to mis-calling of heterozygous SNPs as homozygotes in the low coverage Hapmap2 data set \cite[]{Hufford_2012_22660546}. 
Our GBS data are also at low coverage which will likely result in an under-calling of heterozygotes.
We found that 7,197 SNPs overlapped between the MaizeSNP50 and GBS data sets. 
Excluding missing data, we compared 229,937 genotypes in the two data sets. 
While only 0.8\% of 173,670 homozygous loci in the MaizeSNP50 data set differed from GBS genotypes,
88.6\% of 56,267 MaizeSNP50 heterozygotes had different genotypes in the GBS data, being homozygous in nearly all cases. 
Despite an extremely high heterozygote error rate, our GBS data should be informative given the high correlation in allele frequencies between data sets ($r=0.89$; Supp fig. X) and a lack of major allele or reference bias (data not shown).


\subsection*{Structure analysis}
We performed {\sf STRUCTURE} analysis \cite[]{Pritchard_2000_10835412,Falush_2003_12930761} using  synonymous and noncoding SNPs from the MaizeSNP50 data. 
We assumed free recombination between SNPs without missing data and randomly pruned SNPs closer than 10 kb (alternative distances were tried with nearly identical results). 
Additionally, we removed SNPs showing an extreme excess of heterozygosity, a signal likely caused by paralogy. 
We also excluded SNPs in which the number of heterozygous individuals exceeded homozygotes and where the \emph{P}-value for departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) based on a \emph{G}-test was smaller than 0.5\% using all individuals. 
Following these data thinning measures, 17,013 biallelic SNPs remained. 
We conducted three replicate runs of {\sf STRUCTURE} using the correlated allele frequency model with admixture for \emph{K} = 2$\sim$6 populations, a burn-in length of 50,000 iterations and a run length of 100,000 iterations. 
Results across replicates were nearly identical.
 

\subsection*{Inference of demography}

We tested three demographic models in which maize was differentiated into high- and lowland populations subsequent to domestication (Figure~\ref{model}). 
Observed joint frequency distributions (JFDs) were calculated using the GBS data set due to its lower level of ascertainment bias. 
A subset of silent SNPs were utilized that had $\geq15$ individuals without missing data in both low- and highland populations and did not violate HWE.  
An HWE cut-off of $P<0.005$ was used for each subpopulation due to our under-calling of heterozygotes. 
In total, we included 18,745 silent SNPs for the Mexican populations in Models I and II, 14,508 for the South American populations in Model I and 11,305 for the Mexican lowland population and the South American populations in Model III.  
We obtained similar results under more or less stringent thresholds for significance ($P < 0.05\sim0.0005$; data not shown), though the number of SNPs was very small when $P<0.05$.  
%\jri{not sure a reviewer will buy this.  the data are worse, so we are less stringent for HWE? I think we need to rephrase or rethink? are results similar if you use p<0.05?}  
Demographic parameters were inferred using the software {\sf dadi} \cite[]{Gutenkunst_2009_19851460}.  We calculated an expected JFD given parameters from a diffusion method and the likelihood obtained from the expected and observed JFDs in the multinomial approach of this software. \\

\subsubsection{Model I}
This model is applied to the Mexico and SA populations.
We assume the ancestral diploid population representing \emph{parviglumis} follows a standard Wright-Fisher model with constant size.  The size of the ancestral population is denoted by $N_A$.
At $t_D$ generations ago, the bottleneck event begins at domestication, and at $t_E$ generations ago, the bottleneck ends.  The population size and duration of bottleneck are denoted by $N_B$ and $t_B=t_D-t_E$, respectively.  The population size recovers to $N_C=\alpha N_A$ in the lowlands.  
Then, the highland population is differentiated from the lowland population at $t_F$ generations ago.  The size of the low- and highland populations at time $t_F$ is determined by a parameter, $\beta$ such that the population is divided by $\beta N_C$ and $(1-\beta)N_C$.  
We assume that, whereas the population size in the lowlands is constant, the highland population experiences exponential expansion after divergence: the current population size is $\gamma$ times larger than that at $t_F$.  \\

\subsubsection{Model II}
We expand Model I for the Mexico populations.  We incorporate admixture from \emph{mexicana} to the highland Mexican maize population.  The time of differentiation between \emph{parviglumis} and \emph{mexicana} occurs at $t_{mex}$ generations ago.  The size of the \emph{mexicana} population is denoted by $N_{mex}$ and this size is assumed to be constant.  At $t_F$ generations ago, the Mexico highland population is derived from the Mexico lowland population and admixture with \emph{mexicana}.  The proportion of admixture with \emph{mexicana} is denoted by $P_{mex}$.  \\

\subsubsection{Model III}
The final model is for the Mexico lowland, SA lowland and SA highland populations.  This model was used for simulating SNPs with ascertainment bias (see below).  At time $t_F$, the Mexico and SA lowland populations are differentiated, and the sizes of populations after splitting are determined by $\beta_1$.  At time $t_G$, SA lowland and highland populations are differentiated, and the sizes of populations at this time are determined by $\beta_2$.  As in Model I, the SA highland population is assumed to experience population growth with the parameter, $\gamma$.\\

Several parameters in our demographic model were based on previous studies.  
$N_A$ was determined using estimates of the composite parameter $4N_A\mu$ and a separate estimate of mutation rate, $\mu$, per site per generation.  $4N_A\mu$ was estimated in \emph{parviglumis} to be $\sim$0.018  \cite[]{Eyre-Walker_1998_9539756,Tenaillon_2001_11470895,Tenaillon_2004_15014173,Wright_2005_15919994,Ross-Ibarra_2009_19153259}.  
The mutation rate in maize has been estimated to be $2.9\sim 3.3\times 10^{-8}$, so we assume $\mu=3\times 10^{-8}$ \cite[]{Clark_2005_16079248}.  
Thus, $N_A$ was set to $0.018/4/(3\times 10^{-8}) = 150,000$.
The severity of the domestication bottleneck is represented by $k=N_B/t_B$ \cite[]{Eyre-Walker_1998_9539756,Wright_2005_15919994}, and following \cite{Wright_2005_15919994}, we assumed $k=2.45$ and $t_B=1,000$ generations.  
Taking into account archaeological evidence \cite[]{Piperno_2009_19307570}, we assume $t_D=9,000$ and $t_E=8,000$.  
We further assumed $t_F=6,000$ for Mexican populations in Models I and II \cite[]{Piperno_2006_69}, $t_F=4,000$ for South American populations in Model I \cite[]{Perry_2006_16511492}, and $t_{mex}=60,000$, $N_{mex}=160,000$ \cite[]{Ross-Ibarra_2009_19153259}, and $P_{mex}=0.2$ \cite[]{vanHeerwaarden_2011_21189301} for Model II. 
Note that \cite{Profford_2013} recently estimated $P_{mex}=0.12$, \mbh{my overall estimate of $P_{mex}$ in STRUCTURE was $\sim$0.19, very similar to Joost's.  Estimates from HAPMIX were lower but were based on pretty ad hoc criteria} and we obtained very similar null distributions of $F_{ST}$ between Mexico low- and highland populations given $P_{mex}=0.1\sim0.2$.
Hereafter, we will show the result with  $P_{mex}=0.2$.
For both Models I and II, we inferred three parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$), and, for Model III, we fixed $t_F=6,000$ and $t_G=4,000$ \cite[]{Piperno_2006_69,Perry_2006_16511492} and estimated the remaining four parameters ($\alpha$, $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $\gamma$).

%We used GBS data for the observed JFDs because this data set is relatively free from ascertainment bias.  We screened silent SNPs with $\geq15$ individuals having no missing data in both low- and highland populations.  We further screened out SNPs departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.  Because of the low coverage of GBS data, a large proportion of heterozygotes were missed as shown above.  Thus, we used less strict cut-off, $P<0.005$ for each subpopulation.  In total, we used 18,745 silent SNPs for Mexico populations in Model I and II, 14,508 for SA populations in Model I and 11,305 for Mexico lowland population and SA populations in Model III.  When we used another cut-off such as $P<0.001$ or $P<0.0005$, we obtained similar estimations (not shown).  
 
\subsection*{Differentiation between low- and highland populations}
Based on inferred demography, we generated a null distribution of $F_{ST}$ by using {\sf ms} software \cite[]{Hudson_2002_11847089}.   
The command line options for {\sf ms} are provided in supp Table 2.  
For each combination of sample sizes in low- and highland populations, we generated $10^7$ $F_{ST}$ values given sample sizes and used these as a null distribution in order to evaluate our GBS data.   We calculated $F_{ST}$ values for all SNPs that had $\geq10$ individuals with no missing data in all four populations and showed no departure from HWE at the 0.5\% level. 

Calculation of differentiation using the MaizeSNP50 data is more complicated due to ascertainment bias.  
We addressed this problem by applying a simple method.  
The SNPs in this data set were discovered in a panel of maize inbred lines.  
These inbred lines appear to be derived from the Mexican lowland maize population based on examination of an NJ tree of inbred lines and our landrace samples constructed using our GBS data and SNPs in the Hapmap v2 data set \cite[]{Hufford_2012_22660546}. 
Therefore, we added two additional individuals to the Mexican lowland population and used only SNPs where the two individuals had different alleles.   
We used all SNPs where $\geq10$ individuals had no missing data in all four populations and where there was no departure from HWE at the 5\% level. As mentioned above, SNPs in this data set were discovered from multiple ascertainment schemes.  In the Results and Discussion, we demonstrate that the effect of different ascertainment schemes was not large.

\subsection*{Haplotype scoring test}
We performed a \underline{p}airwise \underline{h}aplotype \underline{s}coring (PHS) test to detect further evidence of selection, following \cite{Toomajian_2006_16623598}.  
To conduct this test, we first imputed and phased the combined SNP data (both GBS and MaizeSNP50) using the {\sf fastphase} software ver. 1.4.0 \cite[]{Scheet_2006_16532393}.  
As a reference for phasing, we used data (excluding heterozygous SNPs) from an Americas-wide sample of 23 partially inbred landraces that were included in the Hapmap v2 data set  \cite[]{Hufford_2012_22660546}.  
{\sf fastphase} was run with default parameter settings.  PHS was calculated for an allele \emph{A} at position $x$ by

\begin{equation}
  \label{phs-1}
  \begin{array}{l}
  \displaystyle{
PHS_{x_A} = \sum^{p-1}_{i=1}\sum^{p}_{j=i+1}Z_{ijx}  / \Bigl( \begin{array}{c} p \\ 2 \\ \end{array} \Bigr) 
- \sum^{n-1}_{i=1}\sum^{n}_{j=i+1}Z_{ijx}  / \Bigl( \begin{array}{c} n \\ 2 \\ \end{array} \Bigr) 
  }
  \end {array} 
  \textrm{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $n$ is sample size of haploids, $p$  is the number of haploids carrying the allele $A$ at position $x$, and

\begin{equation}
  \label{phs-2}
  \begin{array}{l}
  \displaystyle{
Z_{ijx} = \frac{ d_{ijx} - \bar{d_{ij}} }{ \sigma_{ij} }
  }
  \end {array} 
  \textrm{,}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $d_{ijx}$ is the genetic distance over which individuals $i$ and $j$ are identical surrounding position $x$, $\bar{d_{ij}}$ is the genome-wide mean of distances over which individuals are identical, and $\sigma_{ij}$ is the standard deviation of the distribution of distances.  
The \emph{P}-value for an allele $A$ with frequency $p$ at position $x$ was calculated such that Pr($PHA_{xA}\leq PHA_{null|p}$), where $PHA_{null|p}$ are the PHS values for all alleles with frequency $p$ across the genome. 
%\mbh{so is $PHA_{p}$ a mean?}
%\mbh{The previous sentence needs to be clarified}

Genetic distances were obtained from the IBM mapping population \cite[]{Ganal_2011_22174790}.  
While genetic positions were initially only available for the MaizeSNP50 data set, we fit genetic (cM) and physical (bp) distances to a tenth degree polynomial curve, and calculated cM for all SNPs.

\subsection*{Migration and new mutation of adaptive alleles}

We suggest below that many of these high-$F_{ST}$ alleles are locally adaptive,
and the degree of coincidence between highland regions informs us about 
whether these adaptations occurred indpendently (in parallel), or if alleles transited between the two.
To see if the abundance and degree of coincidence is consistent with what is known about the population history of maize,
we evaluated the rate at which we expect an allele that provides a selective advantage at higher altitude
to arise by new mutation in a highland region ($\mutrate$),
and the rate at which such an allele already present in the Mexican highlands
would transit the intervening lowlands and fix in the Andean highlands ($\migrate$),
in both cases assuming it is slightly deleterious at lower altitude.
These numbers depend most strongly on the population density, 
the selection coefficient,
and the rate at which seed is transported long distances and replanted.
We evaluated these rates using new and existing theory, and validated by simulation.

\plr{
A note here on why we assume it is deleterious?  
It would be possible to say convincing things about the case where it is neutral at low elevation,
but will require significant thinking (which I've begun to do\dots).
}

To calculate the rate at which new mutations appear and fix in the highland population, $\mutrate$,
we simply used the total population size of the highlands
multiplied by the mutation rate per generation
and by the chance that a single such mutation successfully fixes
(i.e.\ is not lost to drift).
The latter probability, that a single new mutant allele providing benefit $s_b$ to heterozygotes at high elevation
will increase in frequency and fix in the high elevation patch,
is approximately $2s_b$ divided by the variance in offspring number \citep{jagers1975branching}.
This is not quite right, since such a mutation could occur at low elevation,
where it is deleterious,
and its offspring could then migrate to high elevation and fix there.
Similarly, if we use the selection coefficient for high elevation,
this ignores the fact that some of the seeds from the high-elevation plants may be grown at low elevation,
reducing the chance of fixation of an allele that appears at high elevation.
This scenario has been well-studied in theoretical models by \citet{polk} and \citet{barton1987establishment},
% missing reference for Polk.
but it is not immediately obvious how well their approximations apply to maize,
as it grows across an altitudinal gradient (rather than an abrupt transition) and has high variance in number of offspring.
Therefore, we used the following more detailed demographic model (following \citet{vanHeerwaarden2010}) 
%cite van Heerwaarden  2010 Heredity
to numerically calculate the chance of fixation of a beneficial allele
as a function of the location it first appears.
We found that the simple approximation is quite good,
although the demographic model was necessary to find the variance in offspring number,
as well as the migration rate, which we will need later.

TODO: describe demographic model in words.  (including migration which we need later.)
Reference math and more detail in appendix.

\plr{could alternatively: (a) describe the math; or (b) cut this down further.}

Concretely, the probability that a new mutation destined for fixation
will arise in a patch of high-elevation habitat of area $A$ in a given generation
is a function of the density of maize per unit area $\rho$,
the selective benefit $s_b$ it provides,
the mutation rate $\mu$,
and the variance in offspring number $\xi^2$.
In terms of these parameters, the rate of appearance is
\begin{align} \label{eqn:mutrate}
  \mutrate = \frac{2 \mu \rho A s_b}{\xi^2} .
\end{align}

A corresponding expression for the chance that an allele moves from one highland population to another is harder to intuit,
and is addressed in more depth in \citep{ralphcoop2013patches}.
If an allele is beneficial at high elevation, and fixed in the Mexican highlands,
but deleterious at low elevations,
then it will be present at low frequency in nearby lowland populations,
maintained at migration-selection balance \citep{slatkin1973geneflow}.
(Here ``migration'' is mediated by farmer exchange of seed stocks.)
This equilibrium frequency decays exponentially with distance,
so that the highland allele is present at distance $R$ from the highlands at frequency $C \exp(- R \sqrt{2s_m} / \sigma)$,
where $s_m$ is the deleterious selection coefficient for the allele in low elevation,
$\sigma$ is the mean dispersal distance (mean distance between parent and offspring),
and $C$ is a constant depending on geography ($C\approx 1/2$ is close).
Multiplying this frequency by a population size gets the predicted number of individuals carrying the allele in that population,
which at large distances can be less than 1;
this is possible because this is the average density of selected alleles across a large number of generations.
Therefore, in a lowland population of size $N$ at distance $R$ from the highlands,
$(N/2)  \exp(- R \sqrt{2s_m} / \sigma)$ is equal to the probability that there are any highland alleles present,
multiplied by the expected number of these, given that there are some present.
Since the latter is at least 1,
the chance there are any present in a given generation is no more than $(N/2) \exp(- R \sqrt{2s_m} / \sigma)$,
and so this puts an upper bound on $\migrate$.
Therefore, we would need to wait around $\Tmig = (2/N)\exp(R \sqrt{2s_m} / \sigma)$ generations 
for a rare such excursion to occur.
Concretely, we can use that
\begin{align}
  \migrate \le (N/2)  \exp(- R \sqrt{2s_m} / \sigma) ,
\end{align}
with $N$ the total size of the unadapted highland population,
and $R$ the distance from the adapted to the yet-undapted highland populations.
Another factor this omits is the probability that such an allele fixes;
however, since such alleles arrive by migration, which are planted out into a field,
it is not too bad, and conservative, to neglect the factor of $2s_b/\xi^2$,
if we count $N$ as the number of \emph{parent} plants used to replant the region each year.

To obtain specific predictions,
we then computed $\mutrate$ and $\migrate$ at various paramter values.
We also checked these with simulations and more detailed computations,
described in the Appendix.
\plr{I am flexible about what goes in that appendix\dots}
