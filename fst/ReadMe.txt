1st col: chromosome
2nd col: SNP ID
3rd col: position
4th col: Fst between low- and highlands in Mesoamerica (-9 if monomorphic)
5th col: Fst P-value in Mesoamerica (-9 if monomorphic)
6th col: Fst between low- and highlands in South America (-9 if monomorphic)
7th col: Fst P-value in South America (-9 if monomorphic)
8th col: Gene ID if an annotation is available.  If not, “UNKNOWN”
9th col: synonymous/nonsynonymous/stop changes in transcripts
10th col: mutations in introns in transcripts
11th col: mutations in UTRs in transcripts
12th col: mutations in intergenic regions.  If the distance between the SNP
          and the closest gene is <10kb, distance/gene ID is shown
13th col: mutations in miRNAs
