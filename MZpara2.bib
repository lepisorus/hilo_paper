    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Crop species underwent profound transformations in morphology during domestication. Among crops, maize experienced a more striking change in morphology than other crops. Among the changes in maize from its ancestor, teosinte, was a switch from 100 or more small ears per plant in teosinte to just one or two large ears in maize. We show that this change in ear number has a relatively simple genetic architecture involving a gene of large effect, called <italic>grassy tillers1</italic>. Moreover, we show that <italic>grassy tillers1</italic> experienced a tissue-specific gain in expression in maize that is associated with suppressing the initiation of multiple ears per plant such that only one or two large ears are formed. Our results show how simple changes in gene expression can lead to profound differences in form.</p>},
