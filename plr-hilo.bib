  abstract = {A model of the effect of gene flow and natural selection in a continuously distributed, infinite population is developed. Different patterns of spatial variation in selective pressures are considered, including a step change in the environment, a "pocket" in the environment and a periodically varying environment. Also, the problem of the effect of a geographic barrier to dispersal is analyzed. The results are: (1) there is a characteristic length scale of variation of gene frequencies, (see PDF). The population cannot respond to changes in environmental conditions which occur over a distance less than the characteristic length. The result does not depend either on the pattern of variation in selective pressures or on the exact shape of the dispersal function. (2) The reduction in the fitness of the heterozygote causes a cline in gene frequencies to become steeper. (3) A geographic barrier to dispersal causes a drastic change in the gene frequencies at the barrier only when almost all of the individuals trying to cross the barrier are stopped.

@article{barton1987establishment,
  abstract = {A method is developed for calculating the probability of establishment of an allele which is favoured in some places, but not others, in a large subdivided population. This method is quite general, and could be used to calculate the chance that any system which is linear near an absorbing boundary will move away from that boundary. The results are applied to a population distributed along one dimension. Only mutants which arise within a distance xs223C σ/ √2s of the region in which they are favoured stand an appreciable chance of establishment. The net chance of establishment of mutations distributed randomly across the habitat will be decreased by gene flow if selection against them is sufficiently strong. However, if the mutations are only weakly deleterious outside some limited region, gene flow may increase the net chance of establishment.},

@article{pollak1966survival,
  abstract = {A classical problem in population genetics consists in finding the probability that a line descending from a particular gene $A$ will become extinct. A simple assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 42 (1922), 321--341; J. B. S. Haldane, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 23 (1927), 838--844] is that of a large population where, initially, the number of $A$-genes is small. Another assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 50 (1930), 204--219; S. Wright, Genetics 16 (1931), 97--159] is that of a population with a constant number $N$ of genes where $A$ has a certain selective disadvantage over another gene $\overline A$.

The present author considers $K$ subpopulations which inhabit $K$ different ecological niches with possible migration between the niches. First, it is assumed that there is no limit to the size a population can attain and that the $A$-genes reproduce independently of each other. Let $\pi_i\ (i=1,2,\cdots,K)$ be the conditional probability that the line descending from an $A$-gene becomes extinct if the ancestral gene of the line is in niche $i$; the probability that $A$ survives is then expressible in terms of the $\pi_i$. Next, we assume that the population possesses a large but finite number $N_i$ of genes ($A$ or $\overline A$) in niche $i$. If certain assumptions of independence are made, then the probability that $A$ survives is approximated by a function of the above $\pi_i$, provided these are not all equal to unity. },

Where one phenotype is favoured in one area and another phenotype in a neighbouring area, the character in question may be expected to show a cline in the neighbourhood of the boundary. On certain assumptions the relation between the intensity of selection, the mean distance migrated per generation, and the slope of the cline can be calculated. The relation is used for a provisional calculation of intensities of selection in a population ofPeromyscus polionotus. These have the very low value of about 0.1\%.
